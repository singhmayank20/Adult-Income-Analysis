A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. 
The census is a special, wide-range activity, which takes place once a decade in the entire country. The purpose is to gather 
information about the general population, in order to present a full and reliable picture of the population in the country - its housing conditions and 
demographic, social and economic characteristics. The information collected includes data on age, gender, country of origin, 
marital status, housing conditions, marriage, education, employment, etc.

4. Overall Summary
After understanding the problem statement, which is To calculate if the individual earns more than 50,000 dollars annually or less than 50,000 dollars annually,
I make an assumption: the currency is in US dollars, and the period is one year.
The Numbers of Rows and Columns in this data set are: 48,842 rows and 15 columns respectively.
Important Data Insights:
a) The dataset contains the most people between the ages of 31 to 36. 
b) According to figure on age and income, the majority of those who earn more than 50,000 dollars annually are between the ages of 30 and 50, 
    while those who earn less than 50,000 dollars annually are between the ages of 17 and 45.
c) In comparison to other government departments, federal employees earn more than 50,000 dollars annually.
d) There are extremely few females in the government sector that make more than 50,000 dollars annually.
e) According to the distribution, the majority of persons have completed high school, while just a small percentage hold a master's or doctoral degree.
f) The significant correlation that can be observed is that as a person completes higher level studies, their ability to earn an more than 50,000 dollars annually increases.
g) There are more men in the never married and married civilian spouse categories than there are women, who are more likely to be widowed, separated, or divorced.
    In the group of married spouses not present, both men and women are equal.
h) People earn more money in desk jobs than in physically active jobs.
